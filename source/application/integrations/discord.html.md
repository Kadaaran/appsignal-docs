Discord is the easiest way to communicate over voice, video, and text, whether youâ€™re part of a school club, a nightly gaming group, a worldwide art community, or just a handful of friends that want to hang out.

With this integration you will be able to receive notifications for deploys, errors, performance issues and alerts from AppSignal on Discord.
